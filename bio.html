			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>I am a sophomore at Tufts University, in the School of Engineering, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. </p>

			<p>I really like learning computer languages and technologies. I have programmed in multiple languages, including C++, HTML/CSS, Swift, and MATLAB, and am always looking for new languages to learn.</p>

			<p>When not in front of a computer programming, I can often be found outside or playing sports. I particularly like to play basketball and tennis. I also like to run and hike in the mountains.</p>
